config MAX_TASKS
    int "Maximum number of tasks"
    default 16
    range 2 256
    help
      Maximum number of tasks that can be created.
      Each task consumes one TCB slot from a statically
      allocated array.

config NUM_PRIORITIES
    int "Number of priority levels"
    default 8
    range 2 32
    help
      Number of distinct priority levels (0 = highest).
      The idle task always runs at the lowest priority.

config DEFAULT_STACK_SIZE
    int "Default task stack size (bytes)"
    default 1024
    range 128 65536
    help
      Default stack size for tasks when not specified
      at creation time. Also used for the idle task.

config TICKLESS
    bool "Enable tickless operation"
    default y
    help
      When enabled, the kernel uses one-shot hardware
      timer alarms instead of periodic ticks. Reduces
      power consumption and improves timing accuracy.

config RR_TIME_SLICE_US
    int "Round-robin time slice (microseconds)"
    default 10000
    range 100 1000000
    help
      Time slice duration for round-robin scheduling among
      tasks of the same priority. When a task runs for this
      duration, it will be preempted and moved to the end
      of its priority queue. Set to 10000 (10ms) by default.

config SYS_CLOCK_HZ
    int "System clock frequency (Hz)"
    default 16000000
    help
      The core clock frequency of the target MCU.
      Used by the HAL timer to compute microsecond timestamps.
